Provides an unofficial and (seemingly) pleasant Ruby API Wrapper for the Wit.AI API (Natural Language Interface) As of 1.0.0, most functionalities have been implemented. Go over to https://rubygems.org/gems/wit_ruby for more information.

I want to first off mention big props to the Wit.AI team. They are the true wizards here in making this beauty and by no means did I contribute anything magical. Do go check them out at http://wit.ai/! THANK YOU Wit.AI!

Documentation that you will definitely need : http://rubydoc.info/gems/wit_ruby/

Do also reference the Wit.AI API documentation : https://wit.ai/docs/api

There are other gems that are also Ruby wrappers for Wit.AI, but this was more of learning experience for me! If you don't find this pleasing, do check the others out!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'wit_ruby'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wit_ruby

## Usage

Remember to put this up to access it!

    $ require 'wit_ruby'

To start using the wrapper, create a client with an authorization token given from Wit.ai. Set this either in ENV["WIT_AI_TOKEN"] or pass it on it the parameters as a hash. Default settings can be overridden by this hash as well.

    Default to ENV["WIT_AI_TOKEN"]
    $ client = Wit::REST::Client.new()
    Override token when created
    $ client = Wit::REST::Client.new(token: "Insert Token Here")

The client provides a session for you to mainly do API calls. I suggest you save the session somewhere for easy access.

    $ session = client.session

Please again, do look over documentation to see the full scope of usage and configuration.

### Result

Every method returns a class wrapper corresponding specifically to the results pertaining to it. Each object returned has its own unique defined methods to make your lives easier in getting the specific information from the results. Do look over the documentation to see what you can specifically call.

The superclass that is inherited (Wit::REST::Result) allows for you to easily access the results of the API call. The results is converted to a hash and is saved in this result class.
You can call methods on it and if it matches the result's hash, it will return it's value. For example,

    results.hash = {"a" => "b"}
    $ results.a
    = "b"

Every direct result returned from each method call defined from the session will be refreshable.

Some unique methods are provided:

```ruby
results.raw_data # The raw data from the response of the request.
results.refreshable? # Check to see current object is refreshable.
```

### JSON Specific Calls

Methods that require JSON for the API calls will be generated through use of the class Wit::REST::BodyJson.
BodyJson inherits from OpenStruct and will assist in providing properly formatted JSON for the methods.

Depending on the data needed, certain methods are provided. For example:

    First instantiate.
    $ new_body = Wit::REST::BodyJson.new
    Adding an ID and doc parameter
    $ new_body.id = "Some ID"
    $ new_body.doc = "Some doc"
    Adding value and expression.
    $ new_body.add_value("Some value", "possible expressions that--", "--that can be added to this value")
    $ new_body.add_expression("Some existing value", "possible expressions that--", "--that can be added to this value")


### Message

To send a specific message, use the saved session to send a given string as a parameter.

    $ session.send_message("Your Message")

To send a specific message sound file, pass over the path of the file as a parameter.

    $ session.send_sound_message("Path to sound file")
    
To get a specific messages information from the wit.ai, pass in the message's ID and use the method below.

    $ session.get_message("Message ID")

##### Message Result Unique Methods

```ruby
message_results = session.send_message("Your Message")
message_results.confidence(index=0) # Returns the confidence of the message results at the specified index.
message_results.entities(index=0) # Returns the entities of the message results at the specified index.
message_results.entity_names(index=0) # Generates array of names of each entity in this message at the specified index.
message_results.intent(index=0) # Returns the intent that this message corresponded to at the specified index.
```
*Index is an optional argument of type integer that lets you select the outcome at the specified index. The default index is 0.*

### Intent

To get a list of intents in the specific instance over at wit.ai.

    $ session.get_intents

To get a specific intent information, pass in it's ID or name.

    $ session.get_intents("Intent ID or Name")

##### Intent Result Unique Methods

If it is a list of intents:

```ruby
multi_intent = session.get_intents
multi_intent[0] # Returns each specific index of intent
multi_intent.each {} # Provides access to each individual intent
```

If it is only one specific intent:

```ruby
intent = session.get_intents("Intent ID or Name")
intent.entities_used # Return entities used with there id as an array of strings.
intent.entities # Returns array of entities.
intent.expression_bodies # Return the expression bodies as an array of strings.
intent.expressions # Return the list of expressions as array of expression objects.
```

### Entities

To get a list of entities for this instance.

    $ session.get_entities

To get a specific entity, pass it in's ID

    $ session.get_entities("Entity ID")

To create and update entities, methods require a Wit::REST::BodyJson object with an id defined and optional doc, values and expressions defined.

    New entity
    $ new_entity = Wit::REST::BodyJson.new(id: "some id")
    $ session.create_entity(new_entity)
    Update it with a new doc parameter
    $ new_entity.doc = "some doc"

Deleting the entity requires the passing of it's ID

    $ session.delete_entity("some entity id")

##### Entities Result Unique Methods

For a list of entities:

```ruby
entities = session.get_entities
entities[0] # Index to access each string for the entity name.
entities.each {} # Go through each entity string.
```

For a specific entity, no unique methods are given.

### Values

To create a new value, a Wit::REST::BodyJson object needs to be created with the ID of the entity and new value.

    $ value_create = Wit::REST::BodyJson.new(id: "entity for new value")
    $ value_create.add_value("some new value")
    $ session.add_value(value_create)

To delete, require the passing of the entity id and value name.

    $ session.delete_value("entity id", "value name")

### Expressions

Add an expression by passing in the entity's id, value name, and the new expression.

    $ session.add_expression("some entity id", "some value name", "new expression")

Same goes for the deletion of an expression.

    $ session.delete_expression("some entity id", "some value name", "to be deleted expression")
